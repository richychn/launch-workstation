# Launch Workstation

## Description
Launch Workstation is a Chrome extension that enables users to quickly open a set of websites. This helps with opening up Chrome and with switching between tasks. For example, I might want to open my email, calendar, and todo list when I begin working on homework or personal tasks. Afterwards, I might want to switch over to working on a team project and always need to open Slack, Google Drive, and Trello. As number of websites grow, Launch Workstation becomes a more valuable tool for quickly opening a group of websites. 

## Future Work
I plan to develop this project further if other people find it useful and start using it or if I need to add features for my own use. Please feel free to leave a review in the Chrome store and suggest features you would like to see.
